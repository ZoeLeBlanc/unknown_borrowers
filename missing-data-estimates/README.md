# Estimating missing data in the Shakespeare & Company dataset

In order to estimate missing data in the Shakespeare & Company dataset, we divide the dataset into four categories:

* [Membership Activity](0-membership-activity.ipynb): Events in the dataset that concern members' subscription and other payment information.
* [Members](1-members.ipynb): Shakespeare & Company community members.
* [Book Activity](2-book-activity.ipynb): Events in the dataset that concern members' interaction with books.
* [Books](3-books.ipynb): The books that were borrowed that are missing in the dataset
* [Library](4-library.ipynb): The total number of books that were contained in the Shakespeare and Co library.

The dataset is known to be incomplete and the four notebooks walk through processes to estimate the proportion of missing data in each category.

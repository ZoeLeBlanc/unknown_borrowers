# Estimating missing data in the Shakespeare & Company dataset

In order to estimate missing data in the Shakespeare & Company dataset, we divide the dataset into four categories:

* [Membership Activity](0-membership-activity.ipynb): Events in the dataset that concern members' subscription and other payment information.
* [Members](1-members.ipynb): Shakespeare & Company community members.
* [Book Activity](2-book-activity.ipynb): Events in the dataset that concern members' interaction with books.
* [Books](3-books.ipynb): The books in the dataset.


The dataset is known to be incomplete and the four notebooks walk through processes to estimate the proportion of missing data in each category.
